      <h1>Hello, I’m <span>Abqari</span></h1>

      <p>
        A curious learner, an innovative problem solver, and a lifelong creator.
      </p>

      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Abqari Laraib, a Bachelor of Technology student majoring in Information Technology at Bengal
        College of Engineering and Technology in Durgapur. I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as C
        and Python, and web development technologies such as HTML and CSS. With my expertise, I am capable of designing
        and developing dynamic websites and applications that are both user-friendly and visually appealing.

        As a dedicated and committed student, I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in
        the IT industry. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on society through the advancement of technology.

        Aside from my academic pursuits, I am an active member of the National Service Scheme (NSS), which allows me to
        participate in community service projects that promote digital literacy and empower individuals through
        technology. In addition to the NSS, I also participate in coding competitions and hackathons to further develop
        my IT skills.

        Overall, I am a driven and passionate individual with a strong desire to make a difference in the world. I
        believe that my skills and education in IT, combined with my commitment to community service, will enable me to
        achieve my goals and contribute positively to society.

        <ul>
          <li>Banana Times
            <p>Banana Times is a fun and engaging game that I created in Scratch. In the game, you play as a monkey who
              is trying to catch bananas falling from the sky. The gameplay is simple yet challenging, as you have to
              move quickly to catch the bananas before they hit the ground. With colorful graphics and lively music,
              Banana Times is a great way to pass the time and test your reflexes. Give it a try and see how many
              bananas you can catch!

          <li>Hijab Store Landing Page</li>

          <p>
            I created a hijab landing page using pure HTML and CSS as part of my internship with Oasis Infobyte. The
            landing page showcases the latest hijab styles, fabrics, and colors for modern women. The goal is to provide
            an enjoyable browsing experience for customers with easy navigation and a user-friendly interface. The
            landing page features high-quality images of hijabs with descriptions. This project showcases my expertise
            in HTML and CSS.
